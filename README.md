# TUMOproject
A small project for the TUMO 'Programming 3' workshop

Using Node.js, Createjs, javascript and the jquery library. The aim is to make a small online game that 4 players can join and be able to chat while they play.

In the game, each player controls a tank. The objective is to collect as many gold bits around the map and return them to your base. At the same time confronting other enemies if you see them. You can only see the parts of the map in your field of vision (to be implemented if not short on time). The player with the most gold bits wins.

-The game starts only after the four players join.
-Game utilizes local host
